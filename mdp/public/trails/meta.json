    "description": "The challenge course at Overland South offered a solid mix of technical terrain, tight turns, and obstacle elements that kept things interesting without going overboard. I'd rate it a 7 out of 10 in difficultyâ€”enough to get your suspension flexing and tires gripping, but still manageable for a well-built rig and a confident driver. The course had a great balance of controlled climbs, articulation areas, and off-camber sections that tested your line choice and throttle control. Perfect for showcasing what your rig can do without breaking anything.",
